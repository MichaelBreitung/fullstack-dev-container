# Fullstack Dev Container

## About

This project provides a development environment for Fullstack development in form of a dev container. 
It includes tooling for Go, Node, and Python.
The "base" image is available at [mibreit/mibreit-fullstack:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/mibreit/mibreit-fullstack) at Dockerhub.

## Dev Containers

To use the Dev Container you must have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed on your host machine together with the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
